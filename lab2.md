# Lab 2: Exploring the DIR Command

**Date:** 2025-05-22

## Introduction

This is my lab journal for CIS111 Lab 2. In this lab, I am learning how to use the Windows `DIR` command to find out information about the files and folders in `C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32`. I will try different command options (switches) and write down what I discover.

## Objectives
- Understand what the DIR command does.
- Try different switches to get information about files and folders.
- Practice using the command prompt.

## Steps Taken

1. Open the Command Prompt by pressing `Windows + R`, typing `cmd`, and pressing Enter.
2. Navigate to the `C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32` directory.
3. Use the `DIR` command and try different switches.

## Commands and Discoveries

### Example: How would you pause the display?
- **Command:** `DIR /P`
- **Discovery:** This command shows the directory listing one page at a time.
- **Sample files found:**  
  - advapi32.dll  
  - notepad.exe

*Continue with the rest of your assignment questions, one by one, just like this!*

## Reflections

I learned how to use different switches with the DIR command to sort and filter files, and I got more comfortable using the command prompt.
